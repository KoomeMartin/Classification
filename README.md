# Classification

This project takes you to a next step on tackling classification projects with highly imbalanced target variable

It highlights use of oversampling technique SMOTE and ENN (Edited Nearest Neighbors) an under sampling technique and also combined use of both SMOTEENN

I believe this will be helpful in solving most of your classification problems.
